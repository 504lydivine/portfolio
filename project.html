            <h1> ONLINE SELLING ELECRONIC MATERIALS </h1><br><br>
            
            <p>To develop a webpage for online selling of electronic materials, you'll need both frontend and backend technologies. 
                The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or frameworks like React), will display products, shopping carts, and user interfaces.
                 The backend, using Node.js or Django, handles user authentication, product management, and order processing, with a database like MongoDB or MySQL to store data.
                  Secure payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal are integrated for transactions. The site should also feature search, filters, user reviews, and a responsive design 
                for all devices. Hosting can be done on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS</p><br>

            <h1>MANAGEMENT OF TRAFFIC CONGESTION</h1>
            <p>The management of traffic congestion involves implementing strategies to reduce vehicle buildup and improve
                 the flow of traffic. Common approaches include improving public transportation systems, introducing carpooling
                  programs, optimizing traffic signals, and encouraging the use of alternative transport like cycling or walking. 
                  Urban planning solutions, such as creating more efficient road networks and limiting vehicle access in crowded areas, 
                  also play a key role. Effective traffic management not only
                 eases commuting but also helps reduce air pollution and enhances overall road safet</p><br>
